# python-projects

This repository collects various Python-based projects developed as part of my ongoing programming studies. These projects cover topics such as file handling, SQL querying, algorithmic problem-solving, and logic-based applications.

Each folder contains a self-contained project with its own README and code files.

## Projects

- **[arithmetic-exam-application](./arithmetic-exam-application)**  
  A command-line quiz tool that generates random arithmetic problems and scores the user based on their answers.

- **[bill-splitter](./bill-splitter)**  
  A basic utility that splits a bill among a group, optionally selecting a random person to pay nothing.

- **[coffee-machine](./coffee-machine)**  
  A simple inventory-based drink vending simulation with user input, balance management, and drink availability.

- **[computer-store-database](./computer-store-database)**  
  A collection of SQL scripts to query computer hardware models by price, performance, and manufacturer.

- **[memorization-tool](./memorization-tool)**  
  A spaced-repetition flashcard system with CSV-based storage and support for multiple learning stages.

- **[morse-code-converter](./morse-code-converter)**  
  Converts between Morse code and text, includes a user interface and dictionary explanation.

- **[simple-banking-system](./simple-banking-system)**  
  A console application simulating a simple banking system with account creation, login, transfer, and balance tracking.

## Technologies Used

- Python (standard library: `random`, `csv`, `datetime`, etc.)
- SQLite / SQL (for query-based projects)
- Command-line interfaces

## Purpose

This repository serves as a sandbox for learning Python fundamentals, applying algorithms, handling input/output, and using SQL in practical scenarios.  
Most of the projects in this repository were developed through Hyperskill’s structured project tracks, which emphasize practical application of Python and problem-solving skills. The Morse Code Converter was created independently.
